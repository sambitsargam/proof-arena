# Optimized Expander SHA256 Implementation

## Overview
This project implements and optimizes the Expander-based cryptographic proof system for SHA-256. The core functionalities include proof generation, verification, and handling of cryptographic circuits.

This document highlights the changes made to the original implementation to improve proof generation time and overall performance.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Parallelization Improvements**
- **Concurrency Adjustments:**
  - Used Rayon and thread-scoped concurrency to optimize tasks, ensuring that all CPU cores are utilized efficiently.
  - Split large tasks into smaller chunks to maintain balance and reduce thread contention.

- **Enhanced Data Distribution:**
  - Refactored loops to process multiple hashes in parallel using Rayon’s `par_iter` and similar constructs.
  - Improved workload balance across threads to avoid idle CPU cores.

### 2. **Memory Optimizations**
- **Preallocation of Vectors:**
  - Preallocated buffers for intermediate computations (e.g., for witness data and hash expansions) to reduce runtime memory allocations.

- **Minimized Cloning:**
  - Removed unnecessary `clone` calls and replaced them with references where applicable.
  - Leveraged Rust’s borrowing system to handle data efficiently without duplication.

### 3. **Algorithmic Enhancements**
- **Batch Processing:**
  - Implemented batch processing for cryptographic inputs to reduce overhead.
  - Consolidated operations to minimize redundant computations (e.g., reusing constants and intermediate results).

- **Reduced Complexity in Proof Handling:**
  - Streamlined the proof generation logic by combining smaller steps into efficient pipelines.
  - Optimized compression function computations for SHA-256 to avoid redundant steps.

### 4. **Improved Error Handling**
- **Error Propagation:**
  - Replaced unsafe `unwrap` calls with `Result` propagation for better error handling.
  - Added meaningful error messages for better debugging and user feedback.


## Detailed Changes in Code

### Prove Function
- Integrated more robust parallelization using `thread::scope` for task isolation and reduced contention.
- Optimized witness assignment by batching inputs and reducing the number of intermediary states.
- Streamlined memory usage by using buffer pools for repeated operations.

### Verify Function
- Improved the handling of serialized proofs and public inputs:
  - Added efficient deserialization routines with preallocation.
  - Reduced the number of passes over data by combining operations.
- Simplified loop structure for iterating through proof and input data.

### General Optimizations
- Consolidated constants and reused across functions.
- Replaced redundant operations (e.g., multiple `Vec` allocations) with stack-based or preallocated buffers.


## Benefits of Optimization

### 1. Performance
- **Reduced Proof Generation Time:**
  - Faster execution by leveraging parallelism and optimized data handling.
- **Better Memory Usage:**
  - Reduced dynamic memory allocations and cloning, leading to lower runtime overhead.

### 2. Maintainability
- **Simplified Code Structure:**
  - Refactored functions into smaller, reusable components for better readability and modularity.
- **Robust Error Handling:**
  - Easier debugging with detailed error messages and safer error propagation.
